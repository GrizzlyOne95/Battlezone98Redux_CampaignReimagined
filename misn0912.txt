Your orders are to establish an offensive position at Nav1. Intercept the platoon as they come out of hiding and capture the alien device. We have already dispatched a unit factory to that position. That factory has been fitted with the new GEC technology. Use them to stop the Soviet convoy. Do not attack the CCA launch pad commander. If the platoon feels there is no chance of escaping, they may destroy the relic.
