Well done, Grizzly One. The Soviets have been destroyed. Sky Eye indicates that there is a large deposit of alien artifacts just to the north of where the Soviets set up that base. Looks like the ruins of a city. Intelligence wants to know if it has anything to do with those walking machines. Find those artifacts commander and we will lift you out of the area. Comment out.
