Comrade, let's you and I take care of this little is-have and restore the honor of the CCA, eh? The NSDF pigs have taken our Northern Defense Outpost, stolen one of our recyclers and taken three of our engineers captive. Instruct this APC to follow you to the NSDF compound just south of your present position. Once inside the compound, destroy the jail that is holding our comrades and move the APC together them up. Once the men are secure, get out of that base and I will arrive with fighter support to assist you.
