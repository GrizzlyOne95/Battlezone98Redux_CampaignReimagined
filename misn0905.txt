NSDF Unit Factory reporting, sir. My convoy tried to reach the Deploying Coordinates at Navbeacon 1, but the Soviets have set up a battery of artillery units on high plateaus that shadow the entire area. We need them shut down to reach our destination. This looks like a good spot for my scavengers night away. Unit Factory out.
