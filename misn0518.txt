The object we discovered when we first touched down on Mars, confirmed the nagging feeling in the back of all of our minds. We knew the bio-metal wasn't natural. Someone or something had created it. Now we held an object to contain their complete historical record. Locked away within its inigmatic recesses, were untold weapons and vehicles and countless anecdotes that would tell us who these people were. And where they gone. For now, all we knew was a name. The Cathonians. But we had a new imperative. We had to explore every nook and cranny of the planet's surface. We had to learn everything that they knew. We became anthropologists uncovering a lost civilization whose knowledge could literally raise us amongst the gods. And whose weight could crush us forever.
