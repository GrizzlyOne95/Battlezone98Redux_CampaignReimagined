Back on Ganymede with a minimal Chinese presence, they enjoyed a short period of R&R. Then all hell broke loose as the Chinese launched a lightning swift attack on our base camp on Elysium. A lot of good American men died in that attack, but most of us were able to reach the portal in time. It's a prize command to say the least. The Elysium outpost one had gone from a stable field HQ to a smoking ruin within an hour and a half. And the badly damaged men in units who came tumbling out of the portal on Ganymede didn't have an opportunity to alert command of the situation. They decided to use more subtle tactics. We decided to sit back and wait for the Chinese to take the bait.
