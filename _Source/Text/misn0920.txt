Our attack on the Soviet base really opened our eyes to the power of the Cthonian relics. The Soviet walkers killed hundreds of NSD effort cruts. For the first time, every one of us fully realized that the war and our survival depended on controlling the technology. When a Soviet platoon escaped with one of these relics, each and every one of us begged for the mission to recapture it. I still don't know if we acted out of fear or provato, or perhaps a two blended together at the extremes.
