Comrade, the Americans are advancing their forces from one set of geysers to the east, to a second set just outside the perimeter of our main base. From there they will launch an attack on our eastern flank. You must prevent them from reaching their destination. They must approach from one of three passes. Once we determine which pass they are coming through, you are to move your forces to the exit of that pass and set an ambush. We suspect that once they see you they will attempt to retreat to their previous position. To prevent this we have hidden a golem walker near the entrance of the passes. As soon as the Americans choose the pass they are taking, order the golem to the walker cut off Naft beacon. This will help you prevent their escape. Destroy the recycler at all costs.
