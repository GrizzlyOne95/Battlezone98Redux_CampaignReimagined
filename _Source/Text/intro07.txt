Elysium. The Isles of the Blessed. In Greek mythology the home in the afterlife of heroes and great men. But we didn't find a paradise. Just a dead planet, in a galaxy far too distant for us to see from Earth. Its atmosphere was in the last stages of boiling off into space. And the ruins of the once great city were frozen in brittle. We set to work as soon as we arrived. We were conscious of the danger of Chinese attacks. Despite the portal which could take us instantly back to Ganymede, we felt completely alone on such an utterly bleak and alien world. At times like these small groups of men like us must become tighter and present a unified front or else collapse in a heap of petty rivalries. As it turned out, we had little chance to unite before the Chinese were upon us.
