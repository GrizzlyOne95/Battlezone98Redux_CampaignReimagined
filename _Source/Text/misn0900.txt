The CCA platoon that escaped us has gone into hiding. Intelligence indicates that the platoon is carrying the Cthonian flight log database. They will most likely try to escape to their launch pad several hundred meters south of your current position. Establish an offensive position at Nav beacon 1. When the platoon comes out of hiding, you must recapture the Cthonian flight log database. We have dispatched a unit factory which is equipped for the new Walker technology acquired from the Servers Relic. Your pilot count is low, so use these walkers to stop the Soviet convoy. Do not attack the CCA launch pad commander. If the platoon feels there is no chance of escaping, they may destroy the database.
