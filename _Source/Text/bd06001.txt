I don't have to remind you how crucial this mission is, Lieutenant. If we don't get control of that portal, we have no way of knowing what the Chinese are up to, and we'll have no way of following them and destroying them. Wait for the signal that the diversion has begun, and launch your assault on the portal. Harris out.
