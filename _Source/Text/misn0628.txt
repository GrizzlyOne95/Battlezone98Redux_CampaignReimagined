Grizzly 1, a transport carrying the flight log has escaped. Proceed to the CCA launch pad and inspect it to determine the transport's destination. You'll have to move quickly before the CCA platoon returns to fortify the base. Sky-I reports that you have about 9 minutes. Good luck Commander. Call it out.
