Commander, in order for our Veneucean Assault to begin, you must take out the Soviet's radar array inside their outpost to the north. Sky-eye indicates that the outpost is fortified with gun towers, and Soviet fighters are patrolling the entire area. Take your strike team, find a way inside that outpost and destroy the radar array. Lieutenant-Naltry's team has already scouted the area. rendezvous with him and Navbegan 1 before you start your assault. Follow it out.
