Commander, this is the most important mission you will ever face. The fate of our country depends upon your success here. The CCA has beaten us to Mars, and after the fiasco on the Moon, our forces are greatly weakened. We need you to secure and fortify our region on the surface so that we can establish a base. The CCA has detected our landing and has dispatched scouts to monitor our movements. They are building a base to the southeast and are beginning to fan out to other strategic locations. We've identified three areas with sufficient geothermal activity for building a base. We need you to take and hold at least one area before the CCA controls the whole planet. We've dropped a fourth nav beacon outside the Soviet base. They look well fortified. I do not recommend launching a direct assault. Good luck, Commander. We're counting on you.
