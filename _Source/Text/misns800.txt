Good to have you back, Commander. I was beginning to wonder if you were missing an action. The time has come to rid ourselves of these NSDF dogs once and for all. And just the coffers given us the tool. Your unit factory is now capable of constructing the alien super weapon, the fury. Them you will show those NSDF dogs who is destined to win this war and wipe them from the face of Titan once and for all. Good hunting, Commander.
