This is the APC pilot commander. All of our engineers are on board. One of them indicates that he managed to hide one of our unit factories with his supply of scrap somewhere in the southeast. If we can get him on board, we could use it to augment our force with the extra firepower. Perhaps you can get us in close enough to our stolen recycler. We can bring that back online as well.
