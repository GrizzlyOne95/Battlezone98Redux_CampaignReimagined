After the surprise attack from the Chinese forces, morale was at its lowest. If this new enemy could hide itself so thoroughly, how could we defend ourselves? But to their credit, command pushed us on. We might have complained at the time, but in hindsight, we never would have made it without them. The mission to find the Chinese headquarters was unpopular to say the least, but we went ahead regardless. We had no idea how much worse things were going to get.
