Greetings, Comrade. This is Pac-1 reported. We were caught off guard with the NSDF attacked because of a rescue foolishness. My wingman and these two scavengers were forced to retreat from battle and hide in his supply bunker. I knew it was only a matter of time before one of our brave commanders came to rescue us. We are at your disposal, sir.
