Grizzly one. Commander Simmons and the Fifth Platoon are locked down in battle with a full CCA platoon at the Olympus Monter ruins. They've just lost the Recycler Minnesota. You must escort the Recycler Wyoming to rescue Simmons and the Fifth Platoon. There is a CCA base in the canyons to the north of your route that may complicate your mission. Take all precaution to avoid conflict until you reach the Fifth. All it's out.
