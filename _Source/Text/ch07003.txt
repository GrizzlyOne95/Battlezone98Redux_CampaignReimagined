Excellent! The party will reward you well for your bravery. From the information you have found, we see that the convoy will be using the Eastern Bridge. There are explosives hidden in some crates near the path they will take. Wait for the convoy and determine which vehicle is carrying the fragment of our property. As it passes the crates, use your sniper rifle to detonate the crates. Don't miss the glory of the People's Republic is at stake.
