We've arrived on IO at the same time as the Soviets. They're establishing a base at Navbeacon 2 and are making a play for the Fury Relic located at Navbeacon 1. Commanders Yevin and Miller are searching for two additional Fury Relics to the south. Your mission is simple Commander. Build a tug. Get it out to the Fury Relic and haul it back to base.
