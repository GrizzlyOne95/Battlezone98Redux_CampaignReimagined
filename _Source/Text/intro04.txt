Our new red devil unit was proving useful against the invisible Chinese. But we weren't much better off than before. The boys started seeing the Chinese as being cowardly, and morale began to pick up as we banded together. We began to see ourselves as outgun fighters struggling desperately against an oppressive foe. As our spirits began to lift, Command saw the ideal time to launch a major strike against the Chinese. But they didn't see how things were going to work out. Command had no idea how far we could go, how far we could push ourselves, because of one thing. Hope.
