Alright, Grizzly one. The unit factory has just informed us of the situation. Sky Eye says those artillery pieces are dug in high and tight, so you'll have to use your jump jets to reach them. There's a gradual incline in the surface terrain, your nav one. Go there and use that incline to reach the artillery. Collins out.
