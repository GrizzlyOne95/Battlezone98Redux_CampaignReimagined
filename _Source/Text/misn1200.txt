Soviets are transmitting data from a secret communication tower located somewhere on Europa. Included in the data transmission is the whereabouts of the stolen fury relic. We need to intercept that transmission before it ends. Your heads up clock indicates how much time is left before the transmission is complete and your objective is lost. Here are your orders. Just north of you is a Soviet checkpoint tower, to find a patrol ship pass by this checkpoint of regular intervals. You are to head there on foot. Take out a CCA pilot as he comes in using your sniper rifle to commandeer his vehicle. Commander, you'll need to keep a low profile or risk giving yourself away. Once you've acquired a Soviet vehicle, we'll issue you further instructions. Good luck, Risley-One.
