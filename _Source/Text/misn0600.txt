By the end of our time on Mars, we'd all learned a question our individual value in the grand scheme of things. Collins gave us orders that left some of our people to die. Nobody wants to be responsible for their friend's death, but no general wants to be responsible for losing a war. We learned to trust our generals and to follow their orders, but we all feared the day that we would be abandoned and left to die.
