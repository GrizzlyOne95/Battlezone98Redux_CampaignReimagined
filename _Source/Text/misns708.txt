This is the APC pilot commander. Only one of our engineers is on board. He indicates that before he was captured, he managed to hide one of our unit factories with his supply of scrap somewhere in the Southeast. He says if we can take him to it, we can get on board and start it up. But we don't think there's enough scrap to sustain a long-term attack on the NSDF base. We must get in close enough to our recycler for this engineer to bring it back online. We can worry about the unit factory later.
