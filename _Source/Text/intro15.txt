Command was wrong again. They had assumed that the Chinese battered an underman would surrender, but they had one more card up their sleeve. Planning for every scenario they had hidden a transport in a remote part of Ganymede, and they were heading straight for it. They were hoping to escape the Jovian system and take word back to China. We had to destroy every tank attempting to reach the transport, and then the transport itself. It wasn't going to be an easy target. We had no choice but to risk an all-out assault on the largest piece of military hardware in the solar system.
