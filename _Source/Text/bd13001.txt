Here's the order of the day, Lieutenant. The Chinese are trying to collect scrap to build a new Pegasus, which we guess they would use to get reinforcements directly from Earth. Needless to say, this cannot be allowed to happen. You must seize their supply silos. Be careful though. The Chinese scavengers will be under heavy escort, and any scrap fields will be guarded or mined. You have a construction rig to commandeer the supplies.
