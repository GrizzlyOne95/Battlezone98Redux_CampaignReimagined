Sometimes it bugs me that I am strong and shepherd get all the credit. But we all wanted to win the Cold War. And we were ready to commit our lives to getting the bio-metal. The military boys used all the material that had fallen to earth. And they still needed more. They went looking for a few cowboys to do the job. And in the end, they orchestrated the world's biggest cover-up. It's not a whole army in this space and not a soul-new thing. But now it's time. People should know why it was so important that we won the Space Race. People should know what happened to all those who were missing. The dead should get their honors and they should have their place in history. Because history has a way of repeating itself.
