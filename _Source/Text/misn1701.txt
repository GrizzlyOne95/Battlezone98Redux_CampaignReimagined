The theories have built a factory in Navbegan 1. Factory itself is fortified by not only several theory units, but a very sizable minefield. Our scouts have determined that these mines are being powered by several thermal power plants. You are to take out each of these power plants to destroy the minefield. Once that is complete, you are to move on to the factory, destroy it. Good luck commander.
