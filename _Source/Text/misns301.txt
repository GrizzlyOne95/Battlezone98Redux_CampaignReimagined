The American Platoon known as the Black Dogs has destroyed two of our tank battalions in the last three days. They are currently overwhelming the sixth battalion. We have located the attack outposts that they are using to stage their attacks. Take a small squadron of bombers and eliminate their recycler. We hope this will persuade the Black Dogs to discontinue their offensive. Be sure to reach their recycler undetected. Good luck, cover it. The sixth is counting on you.
