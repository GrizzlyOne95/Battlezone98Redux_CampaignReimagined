This page contains documentation for structs, returned as tables from lua functions.

Camera Origins
-- All number values
-- Note the inconsistent capitalization, this is intentional since it's the way
-- the game does it internally
Origins = {
    Orig_x = 0.0, -- Half of your horizontal resolution in pixels
    Orig_y = 0.0, -- Half of your vertical resolution in pixels
    Const_x = 0.0, -- Normalized coordinates
    Const_y = 0.0 -- Normalized coordinates (Const_x negated)
}
Color
-- All fields are number values
Color = {
    r = 0.0, 
    g = 0.0,
    b = 0.0
}
Fog
-- All fields are number values
Fog = {
    r = 0.0,
    g = 0.0,
    b = 0.0,
    start = 0.0,
    ending = 0.0
