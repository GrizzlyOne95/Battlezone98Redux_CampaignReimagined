Grizzly 1, the Furious Factory tapped the molten core of the moon for power. Its destruction has initiated a chain reaction that has destabilized the moon. Furious are once again attempting to escape. You must destroy their transport and get back to your recycler before the moon explodes. You've identified two approaches. First is to the west of our position. It is shorter and more direct but heavily traveled by escaping furious. Second route is to the north. Its longer, narrower as many branches. However, it has less furious activity. Destroy the transport and get back to your space as you can. Good luck.
