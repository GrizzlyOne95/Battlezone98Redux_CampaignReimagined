Commander, liberty and the freedom are moving on to Titan. Your platoon will remain behind to destroy the CCA unit factory. I don't want them providing any support to the CCA on Titan. Justice will remain in orbit and I have dispatched the Texas to assist you. Once Europa is secure, we'll rendezvous with the rest of our forces on Titan.
