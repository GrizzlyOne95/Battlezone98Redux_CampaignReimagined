We arrived on Ganymede as the struggle for the fury technology began in earnest. We felt left out. We were assigned recon and scrap collection duties. There are a lot of discontents on Ganymede. And for two weeks, our morale and discipline dropped further and faster every day. But then we lost the fourth platoon. They were out on routine scrap duty and simply disappeared. We hadn't heard from them for at least 48 hours. Command ordered a search party. We were all anxious to find out what happened to our friends. But on the other hand, on the deeper level, we didn't really want to know.
