When mankind touched down on the surface of Mars, it was said, at least by the privileged few that were even aware it even happened, that it was our greatest achievement. But the enormity of it all completely washed away when it was discovered that we were not the first. When scientists were finally able to reactivate the device that the NSDF forces recovered, it began spewing out random bits of information. And all probably would have been useless to us had it not been for one odd thing. It was all in Latin. But it gets more bizarre. The device was constructed by a race to call themselves the Olympians. They were from some planet known as Icarus. The scientists began working on a way to access more information out of the device. And once they finally found it, all hell broke loose.
