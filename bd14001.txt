Lieutenant, to the south of you is the last Chinese base on the enemy, capable of constructing a new portal. At the moment they do not have the necessary resources, but we can't afford to take any chances. You are to assemble an assault team and take out that base. A word of caution though. The enemy is mind the area around the base heavily, and there are numerous gun towers in operation. Be sure you have a sufficient force assembled. We cannot afford to lose this one. Harris out.
