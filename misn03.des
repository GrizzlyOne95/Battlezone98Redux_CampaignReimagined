MISSION OBJECTIVES:
- Fight off attacking units.
- Use the Recycler to build defensive turrets.
- Standby for additional orders.

ENGINEERING REPORT:
You will have the Recycler Montana at your disposal. The Montana is capable of gathering and maintaining resources and is equipped to build M173 Badger Turrets.  

The Badger is a vital defensive unit with about a 150 meter fire radius and is best suited for perimeter defenses. When in position, it immobilizes and deploys its STAB hooks (Stabilized Terrain Adapting Base). The STAB secures the low-weight turret into the terrain and allows it to fire accurately unaffected by weapon kick back. The Badger can be repositioned when needed, but it is unable to fire when its STAB is not deployed.
