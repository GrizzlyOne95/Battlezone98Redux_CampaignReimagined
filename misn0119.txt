Good. Notice the list of commands in the left side of your HUD. At the top of that list is the smart reticle command that the unit will execute if you press the space bar again. When you point your reticle at the ground, a diamond marking the location where you could send that unit will appear. Pressing the space bar will order the unit to the new location. Once there, the turret will deploy in defend its position. Go ahead and try it.
