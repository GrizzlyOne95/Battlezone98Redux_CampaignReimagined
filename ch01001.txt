Welcome to Genomead Comrad. We seem to have arrived at the most opportune moment. Our comrades, the CCA, are already on Genomead investigating something that they seem to have found. Their bases to the north. Inspector Hanger to find out exactly what it is. You should know that the Russian chain of command is slow and lumbering, so do not be alarmed if you have to use force to pass some snipers who may be unaware of our visit.
